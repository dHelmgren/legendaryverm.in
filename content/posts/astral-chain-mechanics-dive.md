I've been playing Astral Chain recently, and I've been thinking about its unusual control scheme a lot during that time. I should up-front say that I don't play a lot of brawler or button combo type games, so I may be missing greater context here. 

The high level meat of how this game plays is as follows: You control one or two avatars, yourself and one of five monsters called Legions. 

The first thing I really noticed coming from the few other brawlers I've played is that there is one attack button (or trigger, depending on how you set your controller up) rather than what I'd assumed was the standard two for light and heavy attacks. This choice telegraphs a lot of the other mechanical choices that they made in this game, and to me it said "you will not have time to think about two buttons".
