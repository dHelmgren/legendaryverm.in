That might be a really boring statement to you. You might agree completely with it. If so, this essay isn't for you. On the other hand, if you didn't like how weapons broke constantly, this essay is probably for you. If you felt like the story was too shallow to latch onto, this essay might be for you. If there was a moment in your play through where you got sick of dying all the time to basic enemies, this essay might be for you.
