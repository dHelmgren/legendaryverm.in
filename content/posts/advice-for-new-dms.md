There are a million of these on the internet already, so I want to keep this short, useable and evidence based. Each piece of advice I'm giving here is something that I've done in my own games that measurably improved my game, and the experiences of my players, but it also is advice that is portable and system agnostic.

## Reward the Behaviour You Want to See

This seems pretty obvious, but if you want players to do something, reward them for it. Even if the reward is something that they never use, players will alter their behaviour to increase the number of rewards they get. What parts of your game do you want players to engage with? Do you want them to know the lore of the world? Build puzzles the require them to research or remember the history of the lands, puzzles that give them cool magic items (perhaps referenced in the lore) when they are solved. Do you want players to describe their actions in detail? Give them a +1 bonus to rolls for a vivid description. Plus 1 on a roll is almost never enough to make a difference in the outcome, but soon your players will be describing each swing of their axe with flowing prose that would put Tolkien to shame.

### How I use this

When I started leading my most recent campaign, I was thinking about something that annoyed me from a past group: people showed up to the table each week, and nobody remembered what happened the week before. The old game I had playing was weekly, with almost no time to forget the last events, but the game I was about to lead was going to have up to a month between each session. If players were going to be invested, they needed a reason to take copious notes. 

So at the beginning of each session, I instilled a new process; one player gives a recap of the last session, and for their efforts they get to start the session with inspiration (spend inspiration it to roll twice and take the highest), and they get a sticker to put on their character sheet. The inspiration was a pretty good reward, but the thing that made an even bigger difference were the stickers. My players love them. They look forward to each new one they get. They also use the stickers to count whose turn it is to give the recap by asking who has the fewest stickers.

I swear on my lucky dice, every player at my table has a better knowledge of even their most mundane session than most groups have of their entire campaign. 

## Disincentivize Bad Behaviour

This is not the same as _punishing_ bad behaviour. Being punitive at the table almost always leads to sour feelings, and these people are usually your friends, so let's avoid that. Instead of hurting players or characters in some way, find ways to delay rewards, or make sure that good behaviour is materially appreciated over bad.

Bad has a lot of meanings, so let me be clear: if someone at your table is being a jerk, and you've talked to them, that's not "bad behaviour", that's being malignant. Kick them out of your group. Unless you are game mastering as child care -an awesome idea, but not something I can give advice on- you don't have to babysit someone who is choosing to be mean, abusive or vulgar.

On the other hand, your players might not be paying attention when their turn comes up. Don't skip their turn, just say, "Okay, I'm going to drop you in the order until after the next monster block or player". They don't lose their chance, it just gets delayed. If players are choosing to split from the party and start to take up an unfair amount of time, make sure that they get in over their head often, or make their forays less fruitful. 

### How I use this

With the same group I mentioned above, I realized that I wanted them to really use the resource of inspiration liberally. At the end of the first few sessions, players ended up still holding tokens of inspiration (I hand out toy coins) and at first I let players keep them.

After a while, I realized that a player could abuse this pretty badly, so I changed my ruling so that they couldn't keep any inspiration between sessions. This reduced complexity for me, and meant that they had a much more pressing sense of needing to use the tools I gave them. The bad behaviour -not using their inspiration- was replaced almost immediately.

## Follow Your Players' Lead

There's a quote I like that I've heard applied to a lot of role playing games: "Draw Maps, Leave Blanks". I think this advice is usually followed kind of literally, which is fine, but we could be doing a better job as game masters of actually filling the blanks. 

Players will tell you what is interesting to them. Not directly, but often by way of what parts of your scene they choose to interact with. You can that tell a player is engaged when they spend 5 minutes trying to find a way to foil a trap- but what if the trap only exists in their imagination? We can tell them plainly that the Dutchess is on their side, but if they've decided she's doing something shady, they will doggedly follow that lead until it frays in their hands. 

We can, at any moment, change our plans. We aren't beholden to the words written in our notes, or even those written in our adventure guides. If we are using something to divide the table and hide things, or if we as game masters have any sort of secret information, how much will it hurt us to bend the fiction to reward this engagement? If your players already believe something, let them be correct, or at least partially right. Let something come of the choices they make.

### How I use this

I was running a remix of the excellent Orange Cover version of Palace of the Silver Princess with a small group, and they were spending a lot of time exploring a torture chamber. Nothing was supposed to happen in this room (something very common in the module) but it was thematic and evocative to my players, and they were really digging in. Somewhere in the description of the room, I had mentioned that there were rodents around, and one of my players could speak with small animals. Instead of having my player's attempt return nothing, I leaned into it. The mouse in this creepy room told the players about the murderer Travis who lived down the hall. I the table get tense, and my player asked the mouse "Where is Travis right now?". 

I could have told her what the manual told me; that he was down the hall, waiting to ambush them. But my players told me without any words what they were thinking: "What if Travis has us right where he wants us?". I made my face wide eyed and scared, and in my squeaky mouse voice said "He is right... BEHIND YOU!" and as quick as that we were rolling initiative. My players still talk about that moment, years later, because it played to their expectations.

In a another game, my players were waiting for a noble that they didn't trust to visit them in a drawing room. Initially I had just planned for them to have a tense standoff, and realize that their fears were real: he was not trustworthy. As I had them wait (and snoop), one of the players did something that I hadn't thought of. They moved the furniture in the room to look underneath one of the rugs. 

I hadn't initially put anything there. My notes on the section were not mechanical, but something about what they did made me decide that I wanted to play into what they were doing. So, there needed to be something under the rug. I picked a magic circle; flexible enough to do something scary, vague enough to buy me time. "What does it do?" they asked. "Are you going to take the time to study it?" They huddled, and decided no, they would just make sure that if it was a trap, it wouldn't work. They broke the circle, and covered it with the rug just as their host came into the room. When their host got angry with them, he tried to activate the circle, but of course they had already foiled his plan.

My players didn't know that until that moment, there was no circle, no hidden trap. I don't ever intend to tell them, because it would cheapen the victory. But to them, it felt incredible. They were a step ahead of this guy right when it counted! Remember how he back-stabbed us? Ha! What an idiot!

## Small Choices Add Up

That's most of the advice I have to give right now. You have a lot of power as a game master, and there is a lot of good system-specific advice for different games, but these ideas will keep you and your players focused on the things that matter to you. Ultimately, when we sit at the head of the table, we are responsible for making sure that our players have the best time possible. With these tools, my players are empowered to make better, more interesting choices in whatever system I choose to run.

Happy Gaming!
