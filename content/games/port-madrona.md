A narrative-focused game combining elements from horror games and visual novels featuring the adventures of Kai in the titular city of Port Madrona. 

This game demo was developed as part of the University of Washingtonâ€™s Certificate in Game Design program. My team and I designed and developed a game demo over the course of ten weeks and pitched the concept to industry professionals.

Port Madrona is the fusion of a lot of our favorite parts of media that we love, and I hope to get a chance to expand on the demo that we released. The focus on character and narrative came from our collective agreement that our favorite parts of CRPGs are the relationships we get to explore in character.

For this project I played the part of not only a programmer, but a designer, UI developer and sometimes writer. The result has rough edges due to the timeline of the work, but I think the demo comes together to be something bigger than the sum of its parts. 

Like I said, I hope to come back and deliver a proper episode of this delightful concept with my teammates in the future.
