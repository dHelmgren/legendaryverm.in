Lesson Planning Expanded

The Lesson Planning Checklist contained in your team’s classroom plan is a great reference tool when planning lessons. Below you’ll find an expanded worksheet-style version of this planning tool. It’s not expected that it would be used to plan every lesson but can be helpful when your team is starting out. 
TEALS teaching teams have unique challenges and opportunities when planning lessons. You can (and should) take advantage of the individual strengths and experiences of all team members, but you must also make sure that roles and responsibilities are well-defined. In addition, you’ll need to be aware of all the standard factors when planning a lesson, including student needs (both academic and cultural), classroom setup, and scheduling, among others. During planning, volunteers should look for opportunities to tie in their real-world experiences into the context of the lesson.
When planning lessons (typically a few days in advance), you can make a copy of the below worksheet and fill out the details together. Not all questions will be relevant for every lesson, but you should be sure to think about each issue and ensure you have a plan. Over time, it may become second nature to discuss these considerations as a group.
