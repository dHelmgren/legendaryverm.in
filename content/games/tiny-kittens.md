Tiny Kittens Who Watched Too Much TV, or just Tiny Kittens, is a micro-TTRPG that I drafted in two days for my partner. She and I have played a lot of roleplaying games together that focus on combat as a major pillar of play, but oftentimes I look over to find her listless at the end of a long round of combat.

The game doesn't so much solve this problem as remove it entirely to focus on characters who are more likely to get themselves hurt than achieve their goals. Inspired by Grant Howitt's game [Honey Heist](https://gshowitt.itch.io/honey-heist), I wanted to make a game where players needed to carefully balance their approach to rolls. Where in Honey Heist the player is trying to wrestle with their bear and criminal instincts, in Tiny Kittens the player is trying to use the roll boosting resource of Moxie to avoid having too much or too little Energy.

Creating the rules for the game was satisfying in its own right, but the thing I felt like I was learning through this process was the bare minimum of page layout. This game is intentionally ugly, and where I could have used a program like Affinity Designer to make a very clean looking product, that would betray the spirit of the game itself.

I used Nathalie Lawhead's excellent [Electric Zine Maker](https://alienmelon.itch.io/electric-zine-maker) to give it a handmade and manic feeling on the page. Using a tool like this is kind of a trade-off: I want something that people can actually read and use to play the game, but I also need to make sure the thing is readable. Without access to some of the tools of a more 'professional' (whatever that means) program, I left a plaintext version of the game up on itch.io so that there was a less visually intense version for those who might need it.
