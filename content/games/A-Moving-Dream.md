If [BEACH EPISODE](/games/beach-episode/) is the first full project I released that explored the idea of micro-game mix-ins, then *A Moving Dream* is what what planted the seed. The game is tiny, but I think that focus helps it deliver a lot thematically.

Rather than being powered by some other game system, A Moving Dream is a dice-less game of conversation and in-character reactions where the player who had the titular dream is trying to decide what to do next. That player has a lot of leeway, and can guide the conversation with their words, and with a track that represents their place between two different courses of action, making the outcome of the conversation mechanically linked to the conversation itself.
