A new girl moves in down the street from you. You feel connected and drawn to her in a way that is hard to explain. Before long, you share your secret; you can fly like superman.

This is a piece I wrote in a single day when I woke up from a very emotionally intense dream. At first I just wanted to capture the experience of the dream itself, but as I wrote it down I gained a clearer understanding of its meaning, and of myself. 

Fundamentally, this is a story about accepting that the past is already written; something I often struggle with. I feel like I missed out on so many experiences and opportunities to become who I am today at an earlier time in my life. Learning to be present in the moment as the person I'm becoming is an important step for me.
