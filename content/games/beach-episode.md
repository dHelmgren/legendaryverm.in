BEACH EPISODE is the first game I put out in order to flesh out a thought I'd been having about TTRPG for a while: when we choose our system, we are calling out the broad themes that we want to hit for the vast majority of play, but what do we do if we want something in the same universe, but with a vastly different tone? While you _nothing is stopping you_ from running a Scooby-Doo-like caper in a game like Apocalypse World, following the mechanical edges of the game will lead you back to the tone of the game as written, probably in a way that undermines your goal for changing the pace of the game.

The implementation that I had in mind was this: what if instead of kludging together a fully formed system that tries and fails to capture the potential for a lot of different tones and themes, I instead let the players play some other, bigger game that they already know, and then make it easy to slip back and forth between that game and mine, but overriding the mechanics for those games for few minutes, or even a few sessions. So was born BEACH EPISODE.

The game is tonally and mechanically light, and flexible in terms of what kind of genre it can wrap itself around, but that means that you can have a beach episode that takes place in the far reaches of space just as easily as you could have one that is deeply realistic, or set in your homebrew fantasy world. Character's normal stats are thrown out, as we aren't here to see them run and punch and lie and shoot, and replaced with a couple of simplified stats and a dice system that gently discourages powergaming to get the "best" result.

I'm not done with this idea, and I'm not even sure BEACH EPISODE is in its final form, but I'm pleased with how it came out nonetheless.
