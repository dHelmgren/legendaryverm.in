*What's So Cool About Giant Robots?* is basically a love letter to Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans. It was written up in about a day for What's So Cool About Jam on [itch.io](itch.io), and subsequently found its way near the top of the Physical Games page there for almost a week.

The game is based on Jared Sinclair's *What's So Cool About Space?* and is meant to leave big mechanical gaps for the players, facilitator included, to decide the best way to fill in said gaps moment to moment. WSCA Giant Robots? is fun, light, breezy, and I'm really proud of how it turned out given that it was part of a game jam.
