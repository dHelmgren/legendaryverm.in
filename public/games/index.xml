      <description>Foul Magicians Are Afoot! The sleepy town of Tinsform has recently fallen victim to a grave robber less interested in worldly possessions than they are in corpses. Everyone in town has come to the same conclusion: a heretofore unknown necromancer hell-bent on conquering the region must be to blame. The town constable has summoned a group of adventurers to do what the townsfolk cannot: kill the necromancer.
 Grave Business   Grave Business was my first attempt at making any sort of roleplaying content.</description>

 And We Flew Together  This is a piece I wrote in a single day when I woke up from a very emotionally intense dream. At first I just wanted to capture the experience of the dream itself, but as I wrote it down I gained a clearer understanding of its meaning, and of myself.</description>
